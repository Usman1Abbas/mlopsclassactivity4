CI/CD improves collaboration by automating integration, testing, and deployment — ensuring all team members work on consistent code and models with fewer manual errors.

If evaluation score is below threshold, the workflow can be configured to fail or halt deployment, preventing low-quality models from being released.

 Retraining or drift detection can be added as scheduled or triggered jobs that monitor data changes or performance drops and automatically retrain models when needed.

 To deploy to production, containerize the model, push the image to a registry, and use cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS SageMaker, ECS, or Kubernetes) to pull and serve the model via CI/CD deployment steps.
